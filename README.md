# Perlin Noise Galaxy
# Overveiw
This project was created in unity for one of my art class assignments, which tasked us to create art from randomness. 
At the time, I was exploring how to use Perlin noise generation techniques to generate noise, and so decide to create a program 
that generates nebulas from Perlin noise.

## controls
* "A" for auto reroll - roughly every 3ish seconds -maybe
* "R" for manual reroll
* "esc" to quit
